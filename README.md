# Cardiac MRI Orientation Recognition

This is my implementation of the Cardiac MRI Orientation project. I have uploaded the paper to arXiv. As the paper has not been announced, it is available [here](https://github.com/rxzhen/MSCMR-orient/blob/main/report/Cardiac%20MRI%20Orientation%20Recognition%20and%20Standardization%20using%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks.pdf)ã€‚
